Catalogue module for ImpressCMS

## How to install

Catalogue is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete `/catalogue` folder into the `/modules` directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to `System Admin > Modules`, look for the Catalogue icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go. HOWEVER: If you are using ImpressCMS V1.2.x, you need to update the following file which the version bundled in the zip folder:

`/libraries/smarty/icms_plugins/function.resized_image.php`
